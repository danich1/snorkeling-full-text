# snorkeling-full-text
This is an upgraded version of the original [snorkeling project](https://github.com/greenelab/snorkeling). 
The goal here is to see if full text will improve distant supervision performance.

## Installation Instructions

Snorkeling-full-text uses [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html) as a python package manager.
Before moving on to the instructions below, please make sure to have it installed. 
[Download conda here!!](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
  
Once everything has been installed, type following command in the terminal: 

```bash
bash install.sh
``` 
_Note_: 
There is a bash command within the install.sh that only works on unix systems.
If you are on windows (and possibly mac), you should remove that file or execute each command individually.
